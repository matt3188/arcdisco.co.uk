So the music we play is entirely up to you! We don&#8217;t limit requests. All clients receive a music request form with their booking form, so they can pre-request as much of the music as they like. Please note that we always endeavour to obtain any advance requests which are not already held.</dd>\n<dd></dd>\n<dt>\n<h4>Can you set up your equipment in the daytime?</h4>\n</dt>\n<dd>Yes, we can set up at any time you require. This will depend on sufficient space being available (at a wedding) when the room is set up for the meal, so you may need to check with the venue.

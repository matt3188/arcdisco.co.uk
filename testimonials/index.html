      Andy was brilliant on the night! Having just taken over the pub we did not know what to expect at all from a NYE party point of view so I just booked Andy as his Website was by far the best!. Andy made the night! He was superb. We had lots of families turn up with children, he catered to them all and just made sure that everybody had a fantastic time! I would recommend him anytime! And he was so good we will be doing the same next year!
    </li><li><p>20181203</p>
       Thank you for making the evening absolutely brilliant. You got a lot of people up dancing who wouldn’t normally dance. The set up was beautiful and colours fitted perfectly with our theme. We recommend A.R.C Disco to anyone! ❤️
    </li><li><p>20181117</p>
      Andy &amp; Linda were absolutely amazing every step of the way! Everyone was so impressed with the music and how the lighting transformed the room. You won't find the quality they provide for a cheaper price!
    </li><li><p>20180901</p>
      Dear Andy &amp; Linda,
Just a few lines to say many thanks for arranging the music for our recent 40th wedding anniversary at the Boxmoor  playhouse.
We had so many positive comments from our guests on the song choices from the 60’s and 70’s and such a nice touch to include pre-chosen requests from our guests, they said it was amazing.
The lighting enhanced the setting and the volume was perfect, allowing people to be able to chat at the same time, loud enough for the more energetic ti show off their dance moves.
Thank you for your professionalism and the no fuss approach to the setting up and taking down of your equipment.
We would highly recommend your services and it was a great to view the photos  taken by you on your Facebook page.
With Many thanks.
Bary and Julie

      ARC Disco were fantastic and provided the perfect soundtrack to my 30th Birthday Party. They played the list of requests that I had made prior to the event which were very eclectic and the tracks they chose themselves fitted well with these requests. They also happily took requests on the night and were happy to accommodate an impromptu cake and speech. I wanted to dance into my thirties and Andy and Linda made sure the music allowed me to do this with my friends and family. Andy and Linda were very friendly and professional. Thank you for your contribution to an amazing night!
    </li><li><p>20180915</p>
      Hi Andy &amp; Linda,

      Andy and Linda were very professional and helpful to us as novices in getting a disco/dj for our event. They kept us informed of what to do and their requirements. They arrived and set up with no fuss and exceeded our expectations. They handled the whole event very well catering to the wants and needs of the attendees. All our requests were met they made the event really enjoyable. I would have no hesitation in recommending them, and using their services again as opportunities arise.
    </li><li><p>20171215</p>
      &quot;A.R.C. Disco provided a good disco for our party, having a wide range of music available, including the party favourites liked by our wide range of ages. Everyone enjoyed themselves. Thanks.&quot;

      &quot;Andy provided up-lighters around the room in matching pink to match my decorations. The lighting was amazing - which made the room look beautiful. Music was brill - I don;t think I sat down the whole evening as I was always dancing. Made the whole evening more special - well worth every penny. thank you&quot;
    </li><li><p>20170916</p>

      Hi Andy &amp; Linda,

We had a great time on Saturday, the evening has certainly left me with wonderful memories of a special birthday.

Thank you so much for playing the music from my list which definitely fitted the theme of the evening. My guests were full of praise for the DJ's creating a wonderful atmosphere and taking us all back in time to our teenage years!

I would not hesitate in booking you for any future events with a recommendation to family and friends.

Once again, thank you for a great evening.

Best Wishes

      Hi Andy &amp; Linda,
It was lovely to meet you both on Saturday and thanks again for everything. The party was a success and wouldn't have been the same without you.

Thanks for sharing some of the photos you took on the night. I've shared the album with my friends and I'm sure comments and tags will follow! 

Thanks again,

    </li><li><p>20161029</p>
      Dear Linda &amp; Andy,

Very many thanks for your attendance at Moulton last Saturday! Every one of our guests enjoyed themselves and a great time was had by all. Also, the photos were great and we did not know they were being taken.

 Our sincere thanks to you both for your efforts,

    </li><li><p>20160720</p>
      &quot;Good DJ. Several people complemented the choice of music played. He made note of the sort of music we wanted played and drew up a playlist based on our preferences.&quot;
    </li><li><p>20160311</p>
      Andy and Linda were fantastic. They got the dance floor filled up very well and used our song requests very well. They handled our timing delays superbly and were very polite and helpful. I would highly recommend them and they gave great value for money.
    </li><li><p>20151220</p>
      Everybody commented on the music and said they had a lovely time and that the disco was one of the better ones and would like their details if they wanted a disco. Very pleased I chose them.&quot;
    </li><li><p>20151207</p>
      Really pleased. Lots of people commented on the great music
    </li><li><p>20150826</p>
      Andy and Linda did all that we asked of them and I feel that we didn't use their full potential. They were very professional and contributed to what was, for us, a fantastic evening and I give them our heartfelt thanks.
    </li><li><p>20150819</p>
      Andy was very helpful and did everything asked of him. I feel we did not use him to anywhere near his full potential but he was perfect for our needs. His profesionalism helped us create a wonderful evening and we give him and Linda our heartfelt thanks. Alistair
    </li><li><p>20150628</p>
      Andy provided a great service and was fantastic value for money. I would recommend him to others and wouldn't hesitate to use ARC again.
    </li><li><p>20150614</p>
      He was just right for the event and the guests at my party all thought so too
    </li><li><p>20141006</p>
      Andy was a great DJ on the night and was very helpful in the pre-event meeting. He took all music requests on board, gave some very helpful advice and was calm on the night. Brilliant DJ and I happily recommend him to friends and family. The club representatives were also very pleased and impressed by him and will recommend him to other members. Well done Andy!

    </li><li><p>20140426</p>
      A great DJ and disco, highly recommended!
    </li><li><p>20130418</p>
      Fantastic night. Music was fab. Everyone enjoyed the music which was a fantastic mix of old and new. Would book them again no problem.
    </li><li><p>20131027</p>
      We were extremely delighted with the professional service and would recommend ARC discos to play on any occasion. Andy and Linda made no fuss with our requests as nothing was any trouble for the pair who kept the party atmosphere up by playing a large mix of some fantastic music all night. It was a pleasure to have booked them and meet a very nice couple.
    </li><li><p>20130725</p>
      We hired A.R.C Disco for a 60th birthday for my dad. The songs played were great and included both current and older songs which was perfect for us. Andy and Linda were lovely and were a delight to work with. I would certainly recommend them to anyone and compared to other quotes I received they were great value for money. Thanks so much.
    </li><li><p>20130323</p>
      Everyone has commented since the party on how good the DJ was and that a good mix of songs were played to get the majority of people up and dancing. There was no fuss with set up or clearing away and they did this all at really short notice. Thank you!
    </li><li><p>20120414</p>
      Nice people. Recognised it was a birthday and that they needed to cater for a wide age range.
